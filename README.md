Micro Frontends Application Documentation
=========================================

This document provides an overview of the Micro Frontends application, its architecture and how to run and develop it.

Overview
--------

The Micro Frontends application is a web application written in Angular that uses micro frontends to create a modular architecture. It consists of three micro frontends:

-   Home Page Micro Frontend: The main application and the entry point for the user. It provides navigation to the other micro frontends.
-   Restaurant Page Micro Frontend: Displays information about restaurants.
-   Orders Page Micro Frontend: Allows users to place orders.

Each micro frontend is a self-contained module that is developed and deployed independently.

Architecture
------------

The Micro Frontends application architecture follows the Micro Frontends pattern. Each micro frontend is developed and deployed independently, and communicates with the other micro frontends through the Home Page Micro Frontend.

The Home Page Micro Frontend is the main application and is responsible for rendering the navigation menu and loading the other micro frontends as required. When a user clicks on a link in the navigation menu, the Home Page Micro Frontend uses the Angular Router to load the appropriate micro frontend.

Each micro frontend is a standalone Angular application that is loaded into the Home Page Micro Frontend using Angular's lazy-loading feature. This means that the Home Page Micro Frontend only loads the required micro frontend when the user navigates to it, improving performance and reducing initial load time.

Development
-----------

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 12 or later)
-   Angular CLI (version 11 or later)

### Getting Started

To run the Micro Frontends application locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3.  Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4.  Start the Home Page Micro Frontend by running `npm run start:home`.
5.  Start the Restaurant Page Micro Frontend by running `npm run start:restaurant`.
6.  Start the Orders Page Micro Frontend by running `npm run start:orders`.
7.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

You can now explore the Micro Frontends application locally.

### Adding a New Micro Frontend

To add a new micro frontend to the Micro Frontends application, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new Angular application using the Angular CLI.
2.  Add the new micro frontend to the `src/app` directory of the Micro Frontends application.
3.  Update the Home Page Micro Frontend to add a link to the new micro frontend in the navigation menu.
4.  Use lazy-loading to load the new micro frontend into the Home Page Micro Frontend when the user clicks on the link.

Conclusion
----------

The Micro Frontends application is a modular architecture that allows each micro frontend to be developed and deployed independently. This provides flexibility and scalability, and improves performance by reducing initial load time. By following the development guidelines outlined in this document, you can develop and deploy new micro frontends quickly and easily.
